### Writing Emails

Takeaways:

    * Use AI to write emails: AI can help draft emails, from sick-day notifications to cold outreach messages.
    * Customize emails: Provide specific prompts to create emails that fit the intended tone and audience.
    * Summarize long emails: AI can summarize lengthy emails and list action items, helping you focus on key responses.
    * Personalize cold outreach: Adding details from LinkedIn profiles to prompts can make cold emails more relevant and increase response rates.

Writing emails can be time-consuming, especially when you need to read through an email you received first. This section will cover use cases ranging from a simple email telling your boss you are sick today to more complex cold lead emails.

## Basic Sick Day Email

Imagine you wake up sick one day and can't go to work (or don't want to ðŸ˜ˆ). Here is a simple prompt that writes an email to your boss telling them you are sick.

Prompt:
[My Name: Mario
Boss's name: John

Write an email to my boss saying that I will be out of office today since I am sick. ]

Possible AI Output:
[Subject: Out of Office - Sick

Dear John,

I am writing to inform you that I will be out of office today due to illness. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

I will be sure to keep you updated on my progress and will be back in the office as soon as I am feeling better.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Mario]

This email works but is pretty boring. Let's spice it up a bit!

## Style Modifiers/Instructions

It is very easy to modify the style of the email. For example, you can ask the AI to be 'humorous' or instruct it to 'Include a funny reason'.

Prompt:
[My Name: Mario
Boss's name: John

Write a humorous yet professional email to my boss saying that I will be out of office today since I am sick. 
Be concise and funny. Include a funny reason:]

Possible AI Output:
[Dear John,

I'm writing to let you know that I will be out of office today. I know I'm supposed to be working, but I just couldn't resist the call of the siren song of the local donut shop. I'm sure you understand.

I'll be back in the office tomorrow and will make up the time.

Thanks,
Mario]

Here is another example that is more serious/professional.

Prompt:
[My Name: Mario
Boss's name: John

Write a **serious**, professional email to my boss saying that I will be out of office today since I am sick. 
Be concise:]

Possible AI Output:
[Subject: Out of Office - Sick

Dear John,

I am writing to inform you that I will be out of office today due to illness. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Mario]

## Responding to an Email

Imagine that you receive a long email from your boss with a lot of information. You need to respond to the email, but you don't have time to read through the entire thing. You can plug the email into an AI and ask it to Generate a summary of this and a list of action items.

Prompt:
[Dear Mario,

I hope you're doing well. I am writing to provide you with some updates on our company and to request your assistance in addressing an issue with the user interface (UI) of the software you have been working on.
]

Possible AI Output:
[Summary: John is requesting Mario's assistance in addressing user interface issues with the software Mario has been working on. The issues involve difficulty accessing certain features and the UI not being intuitive enough. Mario's expertise in software development and familiarity with the software make him the ideal person to help with this task.

Action Items:
- Make changes to the layout, design, or functionality of the UI
- Request additional resources or support if needed
- Provide an estimated timeline for completion of modifications]

You can then use this summary to write a response email.

Prompt:

Mario's expertise in software development and familiarity with the software make him the ideal person to help with this task.

Action Items:

- Request additional resources or support if needed
- Provide an estimated timeline for completion of modifications

Write a response email from Mario using the above email summary:]

Possible AI Output:
[Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me about the user interface issues with the software I have been working on. I understand the importance of making sure the UI is intuitive and easy to use, and I am happy to help.

I will begin making changes to the layout, design, and functionality of the UI to address the issues you have mentioned. If I need additional resources or support, I will let you know. I will also provide an estimated timeline for completion of the modifications.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Mario]

Note that you can often combine these two steps into one. You can ask the AI to generate a response email directly from the email you received.

## Cold Emails

Cold emails are emails sent to people that you don't know. It is difficult to get a response from cold emails, so it can be helpful to send out a lot of personally customized emails. Let's see how to do that with GPT-31.

Prompt:
[Company name: Nightfall
My name: Max
Write a cold outreach email to this founder, named Pranav, pitching him our product, which is a neo-CRM. Make the email formal, yet approachable.]

Possible AI Output:
[Subject: A modern CRM to help your business grow

This is neat, but we can do better. Let's add some more information to the prompt.

# Using unstructured information

Say you have the LinkedIn profile of the person you are sending the email to. You can add that information to the prompt to make the email more personalized. Let's use the founder of Strive's LinkedIn as an example. We'll copy a bunch of information from his profile and add it to the prompt.

It is super useful that Large Language Models (LLMs) can cut through the clutter of all the information we copied from LinkedIn. This cold outreach process can also be automated at a larger scale by scraping LinkedIn for relevant information.

## Conclusion

LLMs can help you write emails! Make sure you read what they write before sending it ðŸ˜‰
