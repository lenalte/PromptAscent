### Tips for Writing Better Prompts

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of Prompt Engineering and provided you with some examples how it works. Now, you're probably wondering: why do these examples work, and how can you start improving your AI outputs?

This section covers easy, actionable tips that will quickly boost the quality of your AI's responses.

## Start with Clear and Specific Prompts

Effective prompts start with being clear and specific. Generative AI only responds to the instructions you provide, so the clearer you are, the better the result.

# Be Direct

Vague prompts lead to vague answers. Make sure your prompt directly addresses what you need.

Vague Prompt:
[Write something about climate change.]

The response may be too general or not specific to your needs.

Clear Prompt:
[Write a 100-word summary of the impact of climate change on coastal cities, focusing on rising sea levels.]

This is focused and guides the AI to a specific answer.

Best Practices:

    * Use plain, concise language: Avoid unnecessary jargon or complex sentence structures unless needed.
    * Avoid ambiguity: Make your request clear by stating exactly what you want.

## Experiment with Prompt Variations

How you phrase your prompt can change the outcome. Experimenting with different variations helps you find the best approach.

# Test Different Formats

The format of your prompt matters. You can present it as a question, a command, or an open-ended statement. Each will guide the model differently.

    * Example of a completion prompt:

Completion Prompt:
[The sky is]

Possible AI Output:
[blue.]

    * Example of an instruction prompt:

Instruction Prompt:
[Complete the sentence: The sky is]

Possible AI Output:
[blue during the day and dark at night.]

    * Example of a question prompt:

Question Prompt:
[What color is the sky during the day?]

Possible AI Output:
[The sky is blue during the day.]

# Refinement through Iteration

One of the core techniques in prompt engineering is iteration. Start with a simple prompt and refine it based on the results. Add clarity or context with each iteration.

    * Example of an iterative refinement:

Initial Prompt:
[Summarize this article.]

Refined Prompt:
[Summarize this article in 3 sentences, focusing on the key challenges discussed.]

Tip:
[Always review the AI's response and tweak your prompt if the output isn't quite what you want. Don't hesitate to keep refining.]

## Add Context for Better Results

AI models perform better when they have more information about the task. By adding context, you can help the model understand what you want, making its responses more accurate and relevant.

# Why Context is Key

Without sufficient context, the AI may make incorrect assumptions or provide incomplete responses. Adding background details, instructions, or guidelines allows the AI to generate a more tailored response.

    * Example without context:

Prompt without Context:
[Write a product description.]

Possible AI Output:
[This is a product.]

    * Example with context:

Prompt with Context:
[Write a 50-word product description for wireless earbuds, focusing on sound quality and comfort for athletes.]

Possible AI Output:
[Experience superior sound with our wireless earbuds, designed for athletes. Enjoy powerful bass and a secure, comfortable fit during your toughest workouts.]

# Use Instruction + Context Format

One effective way to improve results is to combine specific instructions with context. This is especially useful in tasks like summarization or when asking the AI to perform complex tasks.
Astronaut

Prompt with Context:
[Summarize this email in one sentence.

Dear team, thank you for organizing the community event. It was a great success thanks to your hard work.]

Possible AI Output:
[The email thanks the team for their effort in organizing a successful community event.]

Note:
[Giving instructions to generative AI model is among the first basic techniques you'll learn about in this basics guide. Read the next several docs to find it.]

## Iteration and Refinement

Prompt engineering is an iterative process. After receiving a response, you might need to adjust your prompt to get closer to the result you're looking for.

# The Iterative Process

Refining prompts is key to getting high-quality outputs. With each iteration, add or remove details to improve the response.

Initial Prompt:
[Summarize this book.]

Refined Prompt:
[Summarize the book's key themes in 2-3 sentences, focusing on the author's viewpoint on personal growth.]

# Layering Instructions

You can achieve better outputs by adding layers of instructions that guide the AI's behavior. The more specific your layers, the more tailored the result will be.

Prompt:
[Generate a product description for wireless earbuds. Use a formal tone. List 3 features and include a call-to-action.]

## Leverage Prompting Techniques

In the following docs, you'll learn about the important elements of a prompt and your first prompting techniques like:

    * Instruction prompting
    * Role prompting
    * Zero-shot and few-shot prompting to show demonstrations to the AI model and the difference between the two

As you become more comfortable with basic prompts, you can start experimenting with advanced prompting techniques to achieve even better results.

You will also learn about combining prompting techniques when dealing with more complex tasks.

## Conclusion: Practice, Refine, and Iterate

Key Takeaways:

    * Start with clear and specific prompts.
    * Experiment with prompt variations and refine as needed.
    * Use advanced techniques like few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought for more complex tasks.
    * Add context for better results and iterate based on the AIâ€™s output.
