### What is Generative AI?
In this section, we'll explore Artificial Intelligence (AI) and one of its most popular branches: Generative AI.
## What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of technology where machines and systems are developed to perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence.
For example, AI can be trained to perform tasks like speech and image recognition, text and speech generation, making decisions, and even playing chess at a level that no human can match.
## Examples of AI in Daily Life
AI is everywhere around us, and many of us use it without even thinking about it:
Voice assistants: Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use AI to understand your voice commands and respond appropriately. They can help you set reminders, play music, or even tell jokes.
Recommendation systems: Platforms like Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify use AI to suggest videos, movies, and music based on your preferences and past behavior.
Social media: AI helps filter content on social media, showing you posts that are most likely to interest you, such as friends’ updates or advertisements that match your interests.

## How AI Works
While AI systems can be created using several approaches, machine learning (ML) is one of the most popular and efficient methods.

Note:
[Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows a machine or system to automatically learn and improve from large datasets without being explicitly programmed.]
You can think of ML as a process similar to how humans learn from experience. Instead of relying on explicit programming, where a human defines strict, deterministic rules for the machine to follow, ML uses algorithms to analyze large volumes of data. These algorithms identify patterns or trends that the machine can then use to make predictions on unseen data, classify images, or perform other tasks.
Machine learning algorithms improve over time as they are exposed to more data. The result of this process is a machine learning model that captures the machine’s learned representation of the data based on the algorithm’s exposure to training data. The more data the model is trained on, the better it becomes at its task.
While ML is a common approach, another widely used method in AI is deep learning.

Note:
[Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn from and make decisions based on complex data patterns. These layers allow the model to decompose the problem into features that each layer processes individually.]
Deep learning models rely on neural networks made up of layers of nodes, or "neurons," that process information by passing it from one layer to the next. As the information flows through these layers, each layer applies a transformation to the data, and influences the final result.

## How Does AI Learn?
As we mentioned before, when using ML, AI learns by training on large datasets. For example, an AI might be trained to recognize animals by showing it thousands of pictures of cats, dogs, and other animals, along with labels (like “cat” or “dog”). Over time, the AI learns to identify the features of a cat or a dog (like shape, size, fur type) that distinguish them from other animals.

Note:
[Training data is key for AI to learn. The more relevant examples it receives, the better it becomes at understanding patterns and making accurate predictions.]
The AI's learning process can be broken down into four steps:
Data collection: Gather large datasets, which can be anything from images to text, or audio.
Model training: Use algorithms to adjust the internal parameters of the AI system (often neural networks) so it can accurately predict or classify data.
Evaluation and tuning: After training, the AI is tested to see how accurately it performs the task. If the AI's predictions or classifications aren’t accurate, its parameters are adjusted to improve performance.
Inference: Once the AI is well-trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## What is Generative AI?
Generative AI (GenAI) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content, such as text, images, audio, and video, based on patterns and data it has been trained on.
Generative AI goes beyond traditional machine learning. Instead of only analyzing data or recognizing patterns, generative AI systems also actively create new data that is similar to what they’ve learned from vast datasets, drawing from patterns within those data to produce something new.
The generated content could be:
Text: Like writing essays, articles, or even poetry.
Images: Creating realistic pictures from text prompts.
Audio: Composing songs that resemble the style of specific genres or artists.
Code: Generating code snippets based on natural language descriptions.

## How Generative AI Works
Generative AI models build on the foundations of deep learning to extract patterns within data and then use this learned information to create entirely new outputs.
For instance, imagine a model trained on millions of images of cats. It learns the defining features of a cat, like pointy ears, whiskers, and fur textures, through its exposure to these examples. When tasked with generating a new image of a cat, the model combines these learned features in new ways to create an entirely unique cat that has never existed before, but still appears realistic.
The same principle applies to the model generating text, code, audio, or other content: it learns the underlying patterns and rules from its training data, then uses those to create new examples that feel authentic.
## Examples of Generative AI
